Argon's build notes:

(BTW fuck this I've included the prebuilt .deb files here in `debs` directory   after spending 1h on building this.)


To get rid of the annoying trash icon which is impossible using the config files I've commented out these two lines

```
  // TrashLauncherIcon* trash = new TrashLauncherIcon();
  // RegisterIcon(AbstractLauncherIcon::Ptr(trash));
```

in `LauncherController.cpp`.

To build and install:

```
sudo apt-get build-dep unity
sudo apt-get install checkinstall
==clone this repo, cd into it==
sudo DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -d -us -uc -b --jobs=8
sudo dpkg -i ../unity_*.deb
```

Original docs:


• Installation

  Please see INSTALL or http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/InstallationGuideFromSource

• Tests

  - You can run `make check` in the build directory to run all GTester tests
  - In the build directory, ./tests/test-panel will start the panel in
    standalone mode, which is great for testing


• Environmental Variables

  PANEL_USE_LOCAL_SERVICE=${anything}
    Makes the panel run the unity-panel-service directly instead of through
    D-Bus activation. This is used for testing how the panel reacts when it
    starts before the service does.
